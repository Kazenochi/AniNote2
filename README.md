This app was created first and foremost for personal use and for practice with the WinUI 3 framework.

With AniNote you can manage your animes and shows and never forget, what episode you are on or when a show is airing. <br/>
Current features are:
* Overview of all shows you are currently watching
* Configure on what episode you are and how many the show has
* Searchfunction
* Quick access through links, to the websites you watch it on

If you want to give it a look, please feel free to download the [latest release](https://github.com/Kazenochi/AniNote2/releases/latest) and I wish you a beautiful day.
